#  Anagram Application

This simple application to identify anagarms of a given word was developed as a part of course work at my university.
The dictionary.py folder will convert the words.csv to a python list. 
The search method used here for identifying the anagrams is Linear Search. 
To run the program : 
1. Navigate to the path 
```
~/anagrams_app
```
2. Run the python code 
```
python dictionary.py
python anagrams.py
```
